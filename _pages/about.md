I received the B.Eng. degree in industrial engineering from Xi'an University of Science and Technology and the M.E. degree in information and communication engineering from Shenzhen University in 2013 and 2016, respectively. I received the Ph.D. degree in computer science at University of Surrey. 

My current research interests include federated data-driven evolutionary optimation, federated learning, federated Bayesian optimization, evolutionary many-objective optimization, and surrogate assisted evolutionary optimization. I am a regular reviewer of IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, Complex & Intelligent Systems, and Swarm and Evolutionary Computation.
